Some thing like what we have in apps like Calm, headspace, It should have no element of surprise ot thrill. Have very relaxing happy, calm affect. It should be long enough that it generates atleast 2-3 min of audio. It should be some story not just some meditative stuff where you imagine something or imagine yourself somewhere, just a plain story about couple of characters.Sometime you would get instructions around what needs to be part of story it can be a message or even a story line. Use that if provided. Provide only story and nothing else. No other line or word should be present other than story content."
